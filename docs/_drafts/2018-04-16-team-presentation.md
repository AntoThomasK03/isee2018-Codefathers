The road from the formation an idea about an application till the final release is long, sometimes dangerous, but it is a route full of experiences and learning. We are the team "Codefathers" and we are about to start this journey. Welcome aboard!

## Team, the project and our skills
The name "Codefathers", as well as the team logo, is derived directly from the movie series "The Godfather". Like the  movie protagonist was able to control everything behind the scenes, we also hope to control efficiently every aspect of the software development proccess.

We consist of 4 people and the sole reason we end up together, was that it just happened to sit next each other in the first lecture.

* **Ejas Nazeerutheen**. He is coming from South india. He has done his Masters in Chemical and Energy Engineering.Before that, he worked as an business intelligence analyst in Infosys, a IT giant, in India, therefore he is not just experienced with Java but also with dealing with clients and gathering information about requirements. He hopes that he will be able to improve his skills in project management using the Scrum principle, and to dive into Android Development.

* **Ilias Merentitis**. A Greek Erasmus stundent. He is in the fourth year of his Barchelor studies in Informatics. His main interest is android application development. He is fascinated with how much somebody can do with such a small device. He has some experience with android studio, and android programing with java. He hopes that this project will help him develop his existing skills further, and to catch up with new modern technologies.

* **Dimitris Tzilivakis** Also an Erasmus student from Greece. He is in the fourth year of his studies in Informatics. He was also working during those years as a full stack web developer and graphic Designer in a small IT company in Greece. He is passionate about design and concept artist, therefore he has previous experience into UI designing and making presentations. With this project  He hopes to improve his communication skills, work as a member of a team and  also learn Android Development and improve his Java skills.

 At first glance we are kinda different, we all share the same goal though, which is to make software that will help people and solve everyday problems. This is why choose to develop an  app that will help people to reassure that their loved ones, have always arrived safely to their destination after a long journey.

... and it will also be a long journey for us from those early steps of this team presentation till the very final release.

## Complementary skills, resposibilities and roles.

From the member presentation somebody can easily see the range of each member abilities. Our skills extends to different areas therefore it is easy to assign roles. Therefore each member can focus on different aspects.

* Ilias will focus more on the coding stage of the application, since he has previous experience. 

* Ejas will also focus on development, but will be the brain power behind the requirement gathering and analysis.

* Dimitris will be responsible for "making everything pretty", the design of the application, the graphic images of the blog and the design of the slides and managing the github repositories.

All of the team member will help into the implementation and managing the github repository

However, those roles are not absolute. Every member can and will take up with different roles and responsibilities during the development stage, as we all want to learn something new.

What is more this flexible way of assigning roles will help us respond to possible changes in a better way, since we would be able to immediately switch roles if nessecary. 

## Communication and organisation 

We consist of people who met in the context of this course, therefore we don't know each other well yet. As a result communication will be one of the first challenges we will face. We have taken of course some very first steps towards solving this problem. 

* We will make use of technologies such online instant messaging, and teamviewer to help each other.
* Frequent scheduled face to face meets to prepare for presentations.
* Direct group calls, if emergency clarification is needed. 
* Github for organising the whole project.
* Use some principles of Scrum in order to have an organised and flexible schedule, apply them through Zenhub 

... and of course hanging out for beers.
