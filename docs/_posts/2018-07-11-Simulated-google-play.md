#  What is our app and why is it woth a shot?

Our app, TripAlert, focuses on something that is not negotiable. That is, safety. It allowes the user to define the details of a trip and then simply checks on them.
Are you late? Have you stopped moving? Have you arrived, or even, are you in a declared emergency? Your list of faithfull and caring followers will know. They have your back. 



# Features

PlacePicker! We take an intuitive map provided worldwide by Google and implement it within our app! No need for learing to use knew things and gadgets! Simply select your destination and your starting point and you are all set.

Timers! Are you still moving towards your destination? Maybe. But the time runs always in our app! Okay maybe not, we still allow you to be a little late but don’t overdo it, the followers will know! :D 

EMERGENCY! Everything runs smoothly, there is no traffic, you are on time, yet still something happens out of the blue? As long as you have 5 seconds to spare you can forget about everything we just said, hold the emergency bottown down for a bit and your coordinates will be sent to your vigilant guardians. 

Notifications: When a trip is finally over, it is deleted from the Display but you can still see all it’s states in the messages Log. 

Phone Contacts: No need to create an in-app social network. All your regular phone contacts will still be there, as long as they have the app downloaded.
